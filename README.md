# cluster-api-webhook

This is a template repository containing some basic files every repository
needs.

To use it just hit `Use this template` button or [this link][generate].

Things to do with your newly created repo:

1. Run`devctl replace -i "REPOSITORY_NAME" "$(basename $(git rev-parse
   --show-toplevel))" --ignore '.git/**' '**'`.
2. Run `devctl replace -i "template" "$(basename $(git rev-parse
   --show-toplevel))" --ignore '.git/**' '**'`.
3. Go to https://github.com/giantswarm/REPOSITORY_NAME/settings and make sure `Allow
   merge commits` box is unchecked and `Automatically delete head branches` box
   is checked.
4. Go to https://github.com/giantswarm/REPOSITORY_NAME/settings/access and add
   `giantswarm/bots` with `Write` access and `giantswarm/employees` with
   `Admin` access.
5. Add this repository to https://github.com/giantswarm/github.
6. Create quay.io docker repository if needed.
7. Add the project to the CircleCI:
   https://circleci.com/setup-project/gh/giantswarm/REPOSITORY_NAME
8. Change the badge (with style=shield):
   https://circleci.com/gh/giantswarm/REPOSITORY_NAME.svg?style=shield&circle-token=TOKEN_FOR_PRIVATE_REPO
   If this is a private repository token with scope `status` will be needed.

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-webhook:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-webhook:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
